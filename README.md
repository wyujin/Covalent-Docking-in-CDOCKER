# Covalent-Docking-in-CDOCKER
Created by Yujin Wu (wyuin@umich.edu) and Professor Charles L. Brooks III.
This contains :

	1. Example CHARMM scripts for covalent docking in CDOCKER.
	2. Example python scripts for covalent docking in pyCHARMM CDOCKER.
	3. Retrospective virtual screening datasets used in the study (./retrospective_vs_dataset/).
	4. Pose prediction results as well as the corresponding prepared ligand and protein structures (top ranking accuracy and AUC value).
	5. General conformer generation methods using RDKit
